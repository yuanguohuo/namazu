The inspectors command starts an Namazu inspector.

If -orchestrator-url is set, the inspector connects the external orchestrator.
For how to start the external orchestrator, please refer to the help of the run command.
(nmz --help run)

Note that you have to set -entity-id to an unique value if you connect multiple inspectors to the external orchestrator.

If -orchestrator-url is not set, the inspector connects the embedded orchestrator.
You can specify the configuration file for the embedded orchestrator by setting -autopilot <config.toml>.


Process inspector (proc)
    Inspects running Linux process information, and set scheduling attributes.

    Typical usage: nmz inspectors proc -pid 42 -watch-interval 1s

    Event signals: ProcSetEvent
    Action signals: ProcSetSchedAction


Filesystem inspector (fs)
    Inspects file access information, and inject delays and faults.
    Implemented in FUSE.

    Typical usage: nmz inspectors fs -original-dir /tmp/nmzfs-orig -mount-point /tmp/nmzfs

    Event signals: FilesystemEvent
    Action signals: EventAcceptanceAction, FilesystemFaultAction


Ethernet inspector (ethernet)
    Inspects Ethernet packet information, and inject delays and faults.
    Implemented in Linux netfilter / Openflow.
    For Openflow implementation, you have to install hookswitch: https://github.com/osrg/hookswitch

    Typical usage: 
		    iptables -t filter -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m owner --uid-owner $(id -u $YourUser) -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 42
		    nmz inspectors ethernet -nfq-number 42
		or
		    iptables -t filter -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m owner --uid-owner $(id -u $YourUser) -j NFQUEUE --queue-balance 0:127
		    nmz inspectors ethernet -nfq-balance 0:127

    Event signals: PacketEvent
    Action signals: EventAcceptanceAction, PacketFaultAction


NOTE: this binary does NOT include the following inspectors:
    Java Inspector:     (included in misc/inspector/java)
    C Inspector:        (included in misc/inspector/c, NOT MAINTAINED)

NOTE: Python implementation for Ethernet inspector is also available in misc/pynmz.
You can also implement your own inspector in an arbitrary language.
